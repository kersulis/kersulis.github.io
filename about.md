This is the personal blog of Jonas Kersulis, a University of Michigan PhD student studying power and energy.

I love explaining and have a passion for visualization.

PhD students are paid to create. Our reputations are based on our creations, the most important of which are research papers. This blog is an outlet for my day-to-day writing. Most posts will be about grad student life, software I find useful, and visualizations I find powerful.

I am currently studying the impacts of wind fluctuations on transmission networks.
