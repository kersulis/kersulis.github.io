Transmission networks are most conveniently represented by graphs. A properly drawn directed graph conveys transmission principles far more intuitively than a bar chart or scatter plot.

Until this past summer I had never used a computer to draw a graph. I found hand-drawings of graphs illuminating, and I always appreciated the presence of graphs on posters and in research papers. Unfortunately, my old computational environment (MATLAB) afforded me no way to render graphs. When I switched to Python and Julia, generating graphs became more straightforward. I generated DOT files programmatically and used Graphviz (which works on Linux and Mac OS) for layout and rendering. The resulting SVGs contained a wealth of information: the type of a node (renewable generator, conventional generator, etc.) was represented by the node's shape, and edge flows were color-coded (red indicated a line operating at capacity). I was even able to embed tooltips: when hovering over a nodes and lines, a user would see net injection and flow values, respectively. At the time, I was writing non-reusable code, so my little tool only worked for one particular kind of network. My aim now is to write a more general tool for visualizing arbitrary transmission networks.

Graphviz is powerful but exclusive. When we tried to use it during a Julia/IJulia interactive session, we realized Windows users would be forced to use JuliaBox if they wanted to visualize graphs. This exclusivity is disappointing, but thankfully it is also unnecessary. With the advent of free and open-source JavaScript libraries like [Sigma.js][1], it is easy to render graphs in the browser. This solution is cross-platform and does not depend on any proprietary/clunky tools like Graphviz.

I scanned through the wealth of information on graph drawing hoping to find a standard file format. Though I am familiar with DOT, I know there are many formats including [GEXF][2], [GML][3], and others. [This paper][4]) compares various formats but gives no strong concluding recommendation. There are many relevant considerations here. The following are important to me:

* Human readable: no messy or ugly formats allowed. Graphs have structure; there is no excuse for their supporting files to lack it. Python has taught me that indentation is an indispensable aid to readability.
* Widely supported: a clean, visual representation is a laudable goal, but it is also important to be able to analyze networks. Any file format I choose should at least work with [NetworkX][5], whose graph analysis functionality is quite powerful. This hardly narrows things down: NetworkX supports GEXF, GML, GraphML, LEDA, and even Pajek (whatever that is).
* Translatable: this goal is difficult to achieve. Due to the inherent structure of some formats, it is impossible to translate perfectly between them. Still, it would be nice to have some format inter-operability.

There is a long-running annual [symposium on graph drawing][6]. It is no mean task to figure out the software used to generate graphs in a [Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications][8] paper like [this one][7]. For most papers
