In grad school, you're either writing or you're dying. I know this is true, yet I hardly ever write. I often go days without writing even to myself. This ends now.

I know how to write, and I can claim mastery of the English language. I'm no English professor, but I know what is right and wrong, what works and what doesn't. What works is simple:  outlining, free writing, reading good writing, and practice. Writing well also requires a certain confidence and patience -- you need to trust your ability to write as well as your ability to critique your own writing.

Today's question:  how do you stay creative? Perhaps a better question for me is how do you stay productive? Everything I've read leads to one conclusion:  there is no guaranteed productivity method. The methods that work generally rely on some model of the human mind -- they work to the extent that your mind conforms to their model. Getting Things Done considers the mind to be one kind of machine while the Pomodoro technique makes assumptions of its own. My own methods are more personal.

When I went fifty-four days without pornography and masturbation, I noticed significant changes in my behavior. I was well-rested and eager to try new things. I had balance and joy. I remember encouraging Jordan one night during this period and being strengthened myself. When summer came and I went to Los Alamos, I let bad habits back in. Schaeffer helped me set up a nightly routine. Her time management is based on calculation:  if you want to wake up at 8, you need to be asleep by 12:30, so you should begin your bedtime routine at 11:00 or 11:30. The routine consists of putting away all devices with LCD screens, getting ready for bed, and selecting clothes and food for the next day. This plan worked well for me. After I kept to it for a week or two, I noticed that a morning routine would be equally helpful. I was beginning each day by staring at my phone. My barely-awake mind wandered in bad directions and led to sin. In the first hour of the day I would begin a downhill trek and never recover. Each day followed the same discouraging pattern. Even today (September 3, 2014) I do not have a fixed morning routine to combat this problem.

I want to wake up at 7:30 each morning, so I need to be asleep at 11:30 each night. My nightly routine should start at 10:30. I have an hour to prepare the next day's outfit and lunch. If I start my nightly routine at 10:00, I can allow an extra 30 minutes for reading on my Kindle before bed.

| 10:00-10:30 | Make lunch, prepare outfit for next day, NO PHONE |
| 10:30-11:30 | Read on Kindle, at least 15 min Bible             |
| 11:30-7:30  | Sleep                                             |
| 7:30-8:00   | Wake up, make coffee, NO PHONE                    |
| 8:00-8:30   | Read the Bible and pray                           |
| 8:30        | Turn on phone, leave for class                    |
| 9:00        | Class begins (Mon-Thurs)                          |
| 12:00       | Class ends (sometimes earlier)                    |
| 12:00-5:30  | Homework Mo/We/Fr, Research Tu/Tr, Pomodoros      |
| 5:30        | Head home for dinner                              |
| 6:00-7:00   | Dinner                                            |
| 7:00-8:00   | Write                                             |
| 8:00-9:00   | Exercise                                          |
| 9:00-10:00  | Wiggle room (still cannot be idle) Co-op duties   |

(This routine may change a bit when Ultimate Frisbee begins.)

This routine follows the conclusions of my 2014 productivity study:

1. A nightly routine is essential.
2. A morning routine is essential.
3. The Pomodoro technique is essential.

Now that I have entered my new routine into my calendar, it's time to tackle my no-lunch habit (one of my worst). This unhealthy pattern came about as a result of co-op dinners. We hire a full-time chef to prepare dinner each night, so I stopped going to the grocery store completely. This saves money but means I have only co-op food to eat. The options are as follows:

* Bagels and breakfast cereal
* Lunch meats and cheeses
* Peanuts
* Dinner

When there is lunch prep stuff available, I occasionally make myself a sandwich for lunch, but this was too inconsistent to become a habit. I need other options. Last semester I ordered two boxes of protein bars from Amazon every two weeks. It was nice to be able to grab a bar when hunger/headaches came over me, but insufficient nonetheless. During my summer at Los Alamos, I visited the store once a week and grabbed around $40 of food. I bought enough lunch meat/cheese, salad ingredients, and yogurt to prepare lunch each day.

This year I want to aim high. I want to ace my classes, make progress on research, and put on five pounds of muscle. It is absurd to think I will reach these goals with my current habits. The only way to achieve my three goals is to strive for an even greater one:  mastery of self. God, grant me your grace to deny myself, take up my cross, and follow you. Teach me to put childish things away. Give me overpowering desire for my work, my physical health, and closeness to Schaeffer. I long to worship you in everything I do, and I give you the glory for everything beautiful in my life. Thank you.
