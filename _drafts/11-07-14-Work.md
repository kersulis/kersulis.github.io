What causes stress? _Not working_.

Anyway, today I had a stressful meeting with my advisor. He is nervous that the research gap we identified will close before I can publish a paper into the space. I share his anxiety. At this point it appears he is paying me to take classes, effectively giving me a Master's degree for free. This is unacceptable. My money is predicated on research output. Am I producing $2k worth of research each month?

That turns out to be a pretty easy question to answer.

How do you respond to that feeling of inability, of impotence? How do you pick yourself up and make yourself productive? How do you recover from a late night of paper-writing that fried your mind and make the next afternoon meaningful?
