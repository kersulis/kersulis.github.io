Dynamic line rating pros
* Higher capacity
* More realistic than using "conservative" approach

cons
* Lines operate at higher temperatures
* Need forecast data for day-ahead planning

Worst-case scenario for convective cooling is zero wind.

Lab verification: verified lab apparatus via comparison to standard formula.

**From 0.5 m/s to 0 m/s is a 25% reduction in ampacity rating.**

Dynamic rating in summer yields 17% additional capacity in summer, but in winter dynamic rating tells you to *reduce* capacity by 8%. In other words, winter line ampacity ratings are not necessarily conservative.

European ISO rep says 80 deg C is contingency temperature.
