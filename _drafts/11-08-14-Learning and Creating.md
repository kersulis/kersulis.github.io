# Learning and creating

What is the best balance between learning and creating? I think I tend to spend too much time learning and not enough time creating.

I learn many things and forget almost as many before I can put them to use.

The other downside of broad learning is that you fail to specialize. This may not be an issue for a high school teacher, but for a PhD student it can be dangerous.
