This summer my interest in making myself a website has increased. Fortunately Codecademy recently released two new classes to teach beginners how to make nice websites. You can make the Airbnb homepage from scratch, starting with HTML, styling with CSS, and tiling with Bootstrap. Completing this class taught me a great deal in two hours. You can also make the Flipboard website to learn about interactive sites. I have not taken this class yet, but hope to soon.
