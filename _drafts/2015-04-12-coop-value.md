title: Why my coop is such a great value
---

_It's more than cheap living_

I have lived in Escher Cooperative House since September 2013, when I moved to Ann Arbor to begin my PhD studies. Before Escher I knew plenty about chicken coops but nothing about housing coops. I didn't know that there are many different types of coops, or that the history of housing coops was so deeply tied to the fallout of the Great Depression, or that Escher House is one of the largest student housing co-ops in the United States today. All I knew was that the price and the location were right. As an Engineering student, I would be less than a mile away from my office. I would also get to keep a much bigger chunk of my stipend than I would if I chose to live on Central Campus or in University housing.

The first Escherite I met was Patrick. He seemed like a chill guy. He told me that I could paint my room if I wanted because I owned it while I was here. As long as I was considerate of the resident who would own my room after me, I could do whatever I wanted to it. Later on I met Steve, who told me that the same rule applied to pretty much everything in the house. I gradually got used to cooperative living concepts like "guff" (which is used to refer to anything in the house that is available for use by anyone) and self-governance (we held bi-monthly house forums where anyone could propose new policies). Before long I decided to run for a secretary position. As Secretary, I took minutes at house and officer meetings and distributed them to the house.

$$\text{Value}=\frac{\text{what you get}}{\text{what you paid}}$$ I knew Escher provided great value before I moved in -- it is significantly cheaper to live here than almost anywhere else around. Escher has a small value equation denominator. Only after living here for over a year did I realize Escher also has a huge numerator. Cheap room and board is only the beginning. I get a community and a home. I get to meet people from around the world. I get to take greater responsibility and roles that are much more meaningful and satisfying than anything in dorm life.
