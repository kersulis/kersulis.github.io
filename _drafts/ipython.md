This past summer I had an internship at LANL, and I decided to re-tool. I replaced every computing utility I assumed was great with one that was actually great. I moved from Windows to Ubuntu. I installed Julia to replace MATLAB's technical computing capabilities. Instead of using AMPL for my optimization research work, I installed the JuMP Julia package (whose author sat at the desk next to mine). Throughout this turbulent time, two pieces of software continually assured me that I was doing the right thing by switching: Ubuntu and IPython.

The IPython notebook revolutionized my research work. Instead of developing scripts in MATLAB and passing data somewhere else to plot network graphs, I could use [NetworkX][1] and [GraphViz][2] to generate a crisp, beautiful SVG and display it inline. With IPython, it became dead simple to document my work with Markdown rather than creating LaTeX documents, or worse, using MS Word. I build up a significant amount of Julia research code, and spent most of each day in an IJulia notebook. When my internship came to an end, I set work aside and spent a month with my family.

When fall came around, I decided to continue applying what I had learned about IPython to my new set of classes. My signal processing professor wanted to write an interactive textbook that stood above the rest. I recommended that we create a set of IPython notebooks to accomplish the task. Awesome examples like [numerical-mooc][3] show how easy it is to do this.
