title: My Most Important Tools
color: gold
---

As a graduate student studying [the grid][tron], my life is relatively simple. People even tell me that grad school is [the prime time of your life][haa]. I do not have dozens of meetings to schedule each week, nor must I coordinate and deal with the [emotion][haa] of a large group of people. I have an [armory][tron] with more tools than most [superheroes][di] have: hardware and software are covered by the university while textbooks and necessities are covered by my ample stipend. I have no excuses; in a country like the United States and at a university like the University of Michigan, every tool [around the world][hw] is at my disposal. But in spite of all the resources, sometimes my mind still feels like a [steam machine][haa].

I have more tools than I could ever use. There are but three that stand out as vitally important; the rest may be relegated to the [outlands][tron]. In order of how easy they are to measure and how important they are to keep pure:

* Typing
* Reading
* Thinking

If I could type [harder][di], read better, and think faster, I would most assuredly be stronger. These are vital skills, and it is vital that nothing obstructs me from developing and using them.

When I am typing, I am often overcome by [digital love][di]. I bounce around between blog posts and open dozens of browser tabs, a [voyager][di] in search of cool tricks that might save a few minutes here and there. This [instant crush][ram] approach to productivity will not do; at this rate, I will never get anything done. My mind keeps telling me I will only feel [alive][hw] if I check my Twitter feed [one more time][di], but I must be wary: sometimes the internet is [the brainwasher][haa]. To be more [aerodynamic][di] --[aerodynamite][club], even-- I need to position myself in one of two modes while typing:

1. Distraction free (nothing but text at 80 characters per line)
2. Complete view (every relevant file displayed at once with minimal effort required to switch between them)

When I am reading, it should be just me and the book, [face to face][di]. It should be easy to make a highlight, and I should focus on maintaining [contact][ram] with that one part of my frontal lobe that lights up when I read faster than I can mouth the words. That seems to heighten retention and allow me to finish a book in a couple days if I need to; to top it off, it seems I can choose to read that way as easily as flipping an [on/off][haa] switch.

When I think, I must be completely free from distraction and peaceful as a [nocturne][tron]. No music, no other people, no computers. Just me and some paper. The problems I am working on now require clarity and [fresh][hw] thinking [beyond][ram] the undergraduate mentality. I need to fit many details into one big picture. As an undergrad I used tools made by [teachers][hw]. Today I make the tools. Today I am responsible for driving [technologic][haa]al progress. Today I teach others. That requires [high fidelity][hw] focus from [within][ram], focus you can only get if you take your thinking seriously. Time spent understanding my work in private will help me answer questions in public. If I spend the next few years hopping from one project to the next without thinking deeply, before [too long][di] I will find myself incapable of summoning the mental firepower it takes to build and defend a thesis. There is no way to [get lucky][ram]; I am [human after all][haa], and there is [something about us][di] that causes us to let a full, beautiful day be shattered into [fragments of time][ram].

My life is simple, but [the game has changed][tron]. I will not be satisfied with my process until I can say I'm [doin' it right][ram]. After a summer of discovering new tools and refining my process, genuine productivity is so close I can [touch it][alive]. After my [arrival][tron] this [fall][tron], I will be ready to [rock'n roll][hw]. [Oh yeah][hw].

[End of Line][tron].
