This summer I transformed the way I get things done. A key part of the process was exposing myself to a variety of software tools and productivity hacks.

* The pomodoro technique has given me a new way to keep track of my time and quantify my productivity. When I get to work each day, I begin my first 25-minute pomodoro and attempt to squeeze in as many as I can around meetings and other distractions. Every pomodoro and distraction is noted in a Google spreadsheet I use to track myself. The technique yields both active and passive benefits:  I am more inclined to compete against myself now that my performance is measured, and I can see bad habits as patterns in the spreadsheet data.

* Getting Things Done and other productivity techniques. I do not actually use GTD ("things" implies I have more than one task on any given day, which is not always true of the graduate student, and "done" implies I can determine when I am done, which is certainly not true of this graduate student).

* Digital independence with LastPass and inbox zero. This 4th of July I decided to declare digital independence and make way on the two most stressful aspects of my digital life:  password management and email clutter. In one weekend I went from thousands of emails across two Gmail accounts to zero inbox for both of them. I also used [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) to change my passwords from weak and oft-reused to long, random, and unique for over fifty online accounts.

* I have replaced Windows with Ubuntu. It may not be [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), but Ubuntu gives me more control over my computer than I ever had with Windows. I am going out of my way to use the command line and learn hotkeys for window management and any other task I perform on a daily basis. My favorite command to run is `ipython notebook --profile julia`, which leads me to my next point.

* I have replaced MATLAB with Python and [Julia](http://julialang.org/). This switch merits its own post, and I plan to adapt an email I sent to a colleague in my research group for that purpose. The decision had an immediate liberating effect, and I believe the benefits will compound as time goes on. I have exchanged a (well-built, useful, but still) proprietary, dated tool maintained by a proprietary, obsolete development process for a language used by thousands of active developers, many of whom contribute their own tools back into it. The two things I like most:  no more software license anxiety, and much greater visualization power.

* The IPython notebook. I know I just talked about Python, but the [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/) deserves its own bullet. This tool has changed the way I do my research work, and has invited me to combine meditation, formulation, and documentation of all my code into one medium. I can be share all of this information, in perfect fidelity, with anyone who has a modern browser, and everything about the tool is free and customizable.

* [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) has changed the way I edit text. Elegant but packed with shortcuts, Sublime is both approachable and powerful. As I continue learning tricks and shortcuts, I find the cognitive burden of organizing my code decreasing.

* A number of graphical software ideas and packages, including SVGs, D3, Matplotlib and PyPlot for Python, Gadfly and PyPlot.jl for Julia, Graphviz and .dot files, Processing, and others. I will not get too sidetracked by this broad group right now, but I do intend to reflect on them in depth soon.

* Other interests I have had in the past have returned. One such interest is the visual display of quantitative information, to borrow an [Edward Tufte book](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) title. The works of [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book) and [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) are exemplary: both provide free, detailed tutorials. My ongoing interest in typography was excited by [_Butterick's Practical Typography_](http://practicaltypography.com/), which I discovered via Twitter.

* I have begun to do all my writing in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Markdown combines the portability of text files with the expressiveness of HTML. It also seems to be growing in acceptance; it is the lingua franca of many of the blogs I read.

* My desire to have a personal web page has increased markedly. There is something appealing about building it myself from scratch rather than taking a WordPress approach. Google's Polymer project seems like a cool direction to take, but at the time of this writing I am storing my blog posts as `.md` files in Dropbox.

As you can see, I am a Highly Distracted Individualâ„¢. The pomodoro technique has helped me manage this in my day-to-day work, and with a little luck (read: blogging) I think I can make something positive out of this digital wanderlust. Last week someone actually told me I should blog about the things I have found. I'm happy to oblige!
