My new night routine has improved my life. I no longer stare at screens until 1 AM. I am, however, messing up the mornings. I get up too late and am vulnerable to negative thoughts from the start. I need a new morning routine.

Getting up at the same time each day will help me establish good habits. The first change is to start my bedtime routine at 10:30 instead of 11:00. I should be asleep by midnight so I can comfortably wake up at 8:00 each morning.

If I wake up at 8:00, I will want to rush to work, but I must initially resist. The morning is quiet, and often the first thing I do in that silence is reach for my phone. Big mistake. Not only is the phone bad for my eyes, but there is nothing productive to be done with it during my first waking moments. Only bad things happen. Currently my phone is my alarm. Perhaps it should not be.

If I had a dedicated alarm clock I could shut down my phone each night and put it away. That would make it easier to focus on God in the morning, to spend the silent time in prayer and reading. The first item on my morning routine: read the Bible and pray, even if only for a few minutes. Next item: get clothed and ready for the day. Third item: head out the door. No sense dawdling at home when there is work to be done. Time is wasting!

This new morning routine is only a slight departure from the one I currently have, which is basically "get up, do whatever for a half hour, then go to work." The difference now is discipline, consistency, and time with God. This simple routine change will be a great help to me as I strive for purity and enjoyment of God above all else.
