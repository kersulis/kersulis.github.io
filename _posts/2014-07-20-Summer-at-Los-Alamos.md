title: A Fruitful Summer at Los Alamos

<!-- Today I make my first blog post in weeks. I also extend the pomodoro technique to meditation and my time with God.
 -->
This summer has exposed me to more new ideas and processes than any in memory.


* The pomodoro technique has given me a new way to keep track of my time and quantify my productivity. When I get to work each day, I begin my first 25-minute pomodoro and attempt to squeeze in as many as I can around meetings and other distractions. Every pomodoro and distraction is noted in a Google spreadsheet I use to track myself. I believe the pomodoro technique will yield both active and passive benefits:  I will be more inclined to compete against myself now that my performance is measured, and any trouble spots that remain will appear as patterns in my spreadsheet data.

* Getting Things Done and other productivity techniques. I do not actually use GTD ("things" implies I have more than one task on any given day, which is not always true of the graduate student, and "done" implies I can determine when I am done, which is certainly not true of this graduate student).

* Digital independence with LastPass and inbox zero. This 4th of July I decided to declare digital independence and make way on the two most stressful aspects of my digital life:  password management and email clutter. In one weekend I went from thousands of emails across two Gmail accounts to zero inbox for both of them. I also used LastPass to change my passwords from weak and oft-reused to long, random, and unique for over fifty online accounts.

* I have replaced Windows with Ubuntu. It may not be Arch Linux, but Ubuntu gives me more control over my computer than I ever had with Windows. I am going out of my way to use the command line and learn hotkeys for window management and any other task I perform on a daily basis. My favorite command to run is `ipython notebook --profile julia`, which leads me to my next point.

* I have replaced MATLAB with Python and Julia. This switch merits its own post, and I plan to adapt an email I sent to a colleague in my research group for that purpose. The decision had an immediate liberating effect, and I believe the benefits will compound as time goes on. I have exchanged a (well-built, useful, but still) proprietary, dated tool maintained by a proprietary, obsolete development process for a language used by thousands of active developers, many of whom contribute their own tools back into it. The two things I like most:  no more software license anxiety, and much greater visualization power.

* The IPython notebook. I know I just talked about Python, but the IPython notebook deserves its own bullet. This tool has changed the way I do my research work, and has invited me to combine meditation, formulation, and documentation of all my code into one medium. I can be share all of this information, in perfect fidelity, with anyone who has a modern browser, and everything about the tool is free and customizable.

* Sublime text has changed the way I edit text. Elegant but packed with shortcuts, Sublime is both approachable and powerful. As I continue learning tricks and shortcuts, I find the cognitive burden of organizing my code decreasing.

* A number of graphical software ideas and packages, including SVGs, D3, Matplotlib and PyPlot for Python, Gadfly and PyPlot.jl for Julia, Graphviz and .dot files, Processing, and others. I will not get too sidetracked by this broad group right now, but I do intend to reflect on them in depth soon.

* Other interests I have had in the past have returned. One such interest is the visual display of quantitative information, to borrow an Edward Tufte book title. The works of Scott Murray and Mike Bostock are exemplary, and both men are eager to explain their process for free to anyone with an interest. My ongoing interest in typography was excited by _Butterick's Practical Typography_, which I discovered in a Tweet.

* I have begun to do all my writing in Markdown. I have used a number of tools previously, and Markdown seems to replace them all with a syntax that is readable, powerful, and portable. It also seems to be growing in acceptance; it is the lingua franca of many of the blogs I read.

* My desire to have a personal web page has increased markedly. There is something appealing about building it myself from scratch rather than taking a WordPress approach. Google's Polymer project seems like a cool direction to take, but at the time of this writing I am storing my blog posts as .md files in Dropbox.

As you can see, I am a Highly Distracted Individualâ„¢. I seem fated to have broad interests and a constant thirst for information. The pomodoro technique has helped me manage this in my day-to-day work, and with a little luck (read: blogging) I think I can turn my potentially damning behavior into a strength. Last week someone actually told me I should blog about the things I have been finding. I will take that as a sign, thank you very much.

It is Sunday morning at the time of this writing, and I am a follower of Christ. If personal relationships suffer in today's digital culture, relationships with God suffer even more. The Pomodoro technique is poorly suited to spending time with God; how can I put a timer on meditation? Were I to apply the Pomodoro technique to my relationship with my girlfriend, I would quickly drive her crazy. But if I do not apply any willpower, I am distracted in minutes. Maybe there is a way to modify the Pomodoro technique to turn down the intensity while keeping the focus.

The Pomodoro technique says to work in twenty-five minute sprints with five minutes between them. The five minutes' flexibility makes all the difference. If someone interrupts me with a quick question or I need to look something up, I just use one of the minutes a bit early. Though my concentration may have been broken, I am still on track. This distributed flexibility has played an important role in my decision to continue using the technique. What if I placed two Pomodoros together and distributed ten minutes of slack? This longer time period requires no timer; I need only glance at the clock. The ten minutes of spare time may not make a practical difference, but they do help relieve the mental pressure of a ticking clock. When I give two Pomodoros to God, I am simply saying that I will spend an hour with Him, an hour of focus free from pressure.

When I think back to my life before gadgets and computers, that last sentence sounds silly. Giving an hour of focus to God was so easy I took it for granted. Now I put a fancy name like "double Pomodoro" on it so my mind recognizes its importance. I do hope that my new technique ultimately returns my time with God to the way it was years ago.

Typing away with Sublime Text's "distraction free mode", I have reached the 1,200 word mark in about an hour. If I write 1,200 words each morning, I will become a better writer and more relaxed, introspective person. This will be good for me, a great reason to get up early. My goal for this week is to write at least 750 words a day before going to work. This will require motivation, and you know what would really motivate me? Having a personal website to display those 750 words. I sense an afternoon project coming on...
