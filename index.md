## Research

I am currently studying the impacts of wind fluctuations on transmission and subtransmission networks. Check out [my research page]({{ site.baseurl }}research) and [email me](mailto:kersulis@umich.edu) to find out more or collaborate.

## Teaching

I love making sense of complicated ideas and communicating them to others. I give [presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}presentations), of course, but my favorite communication tools are visualization and code, as illustrated by [my projects]({{ site.baseurl }}projects). This approach is well-suited to EECS 551 (Mathematical Methods for Signal Processing), for which I have been a graduate student instructor.

## Writing

Writing about the process helps me make sense of it. Most <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}posts">posts</a> on this site will be about grad student life, software I find useful, and visualizations I find powerful.
