I completed a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2020. I am currently assisting Professor Raj Nadakuditi in the development of interactive data science teaching material, while searching for full-time employment.

## Power systems research

During my PhD I worked with Dr. Ian Hiskens to study various impacts of wind fluctuations on transmission and subtransmission networks. I also studied the graph structure of transmission networks, electric load profile time series, and tap-changing transformer behavior in the presence of renewable fluctuations. Check out [my research page]({{ site.baseurl }}research) to find out more, or [email me](mailto:kersulis@umich.edu) if you would like to discuss.

## Data science

My current work for Professor Raj Nadakuditi involves editing, testing, and expanding interactive teaching material for a course on computational data science. In its modern form, the course has been taught to hundreds of students at both the University of Michigan and MIT. I have been a member of the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) team for the course several times. This experience has made me deeply familiar with numerous data science theoretical concepts and algorithm implementations.

## Interactive visualization

I have always been passionate about visualizing data. Over the course of my research I encountered a great deal of data, often quite complex. In some cases a static visualization cannot capture what I would like to see; something dynamic is required. It is at these times that I find the greatest opportunities to leverage interactivity and motion to help myself and others explore and experience the data. The following posts introduce a few examples of dynamic or interactive visualizations I've crafted:

- [Maximal cliques and SDP performance]({{ site.baseurl }}2017/09/01/clique-merge/)
- [Low-rank shift factors and electrical coordinates]({{ site.baseurl }}2017/08/09/low-rank-shift-factor-coordinates/)
- [Visualizing power grids with D3]({{ site.baseurl }}2016/03/15/grid-d3/)

My passion for rich, interactive visualizations is closely tied to my interest in teaching.

## Graduate and undergraduate teaching

I love making sense of complicated ideas and communicating them to others. I give [presentations]({{ site.baseurl }}presentations), of course, but my favorite communication tools are visualization and code, as illustrated by [my teaching projects]({{ site.baseurl }}teaching). This approach is well-suited to EECS 551/598 (Mathematical Methods for Signal Processing) at the University of Michigan. This course is rapidly developing into a large-scale, multi-university computational data science course.
